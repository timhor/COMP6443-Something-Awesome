# COMP6443 Something Awesome

[Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) teaches the basics of server-side web-security. There are 34 'levels' (challenges) in total; I plan to complete all of them over the course of T1 2019, which works out to 3 or 4 levels per week.

In my write-ups, I will be covering the nature of the exploit and how I arrived at the solution, along with any tools I used. If applicable, I will also include the concepts I used from COMP6443, as well as a way of preventing/mitigating the attack.

Goals:
- Gain knowledge of server-side exploits and record my learnings along the way
- Apply concepts learnt from COMP6443 as well as in my own research
- Develop both attacker and defender mindsets when solving challenges
